# This is the default kustomization that applies the base configuration.
# For environment-specific deployments, use the overlays instead:
#
# Local development (with local PostgreSQL):
#   kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/local
#
# Development environment:
#   kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev
#
# To add a new environment, create a new overlay directory under k8s/overlays/
